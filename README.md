# WitchyBND
ivi's fork of Yabber, the binder unpacker and format serializer by TKGP, bundling contributions by various community members and adding some quality-of-life features.
WitchyBND continues where Yabber+ by Nordgaren left off.

This fork is focused on **ELDEN RING** development and is untested with other games in the series. TKGP's original Yabber is likely the best for those.

New additions include:
* Breaks down BND folder structure to avoid excessive nesting in unpacked folders
* File globbing pattern support in the commandline
* regulation.bin support (Decrypt->unpack and repack->encrypt)
* Slightly improved Oodle DLL detection
* PARAM support (using Paramdex and DefPatch. Compact, readable output)
* FXR support
* MATBIN support (by Avocado)
* MTD support (by Avocado)
* ELDEN RING GPARAM support (by Avocado)
* Console TPF unpacking (but not repacking)
* Minor fixes like ELDEN RING envmap TPF unpack
* MQB support (by NatsuDragneelTheFireDragon)
* Support for Armored Core VI DCX archives

Planned (but TBD):
* Small UI for quality-of-life actions outside of unpacking/repacking (like duplicating AEGs, CHRs, PARTSBND...)
* Other formats from YabberAvocado (Let me know which ones are needed the most)
* Other formats from other Yabber forks (Let me know which are flying around the community)

## Yabber
An unpacker/repacker for common Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring, Armored Core VI file formats. Supports .bnd, .bhd/.bdt, .dcx, .fltparam, .fmg, .gparam, .luagnl, .luainfo, and .tpf.
Does not support dvdbnds (the very large bhd/bdt pairs in the main game directory); use [UDSFM](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1304) or [UXM](https://www.nexusmods.com/sekiro/mods/26) to unpack those first.  
Requires [.NET Desktop Runtime 7.0](https://aka.ms/dotnet/7.0/windowsdesktop-runtime-win-x64.exe).  

Please see the included readme for detailed instructions.

# Changelog
## WitchyBND
