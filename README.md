# WitchyBND
A continuation of Yabber, the FromSoftware file format unpacker and serializer by TKGP, bundling contributions by various community members and adding some quality-of-life features. WitchyBND continues where Yabber+ by Nordgaren left off.

WitchyBND supports FromSoftware games from Demon's Souls onwards, but is primarily tested with ELDEN RING and ARMORED CORE VI. Report any issues you may find with other games.

New additions to WitchyBND include:
* Breaks down BND folder structure to avoid excessive nesting in unpacked folders
* File globbing pattern support in the commandline
* regulation.bin support (Decrypt->unpack and repack->encrypt)
* Slightly improved Oodle DLL detection
* PARAM support (using Paramdex and DefPatch. Compact, readable output)
* FXR support
* MATBIN support (by Avocado)
* MTD support (by Avocado)
* ELDEN RING GPARAM support (by Avocado)
* Console TPF unpacking (but not repacking)
* Minor fixes like ELDEN RING envmap TPF unpack
* MQB support (by NatsuDragneelTheFireDragon)
* Support for Armored Core VI DCX archives

Planned (but TBD):
* Small UI for quality-of-life actions outside of unpacking/repacking (like duplicating AEGs, CHRs, PARTSBND...)
* Other formats from YabberAvocado (Let me know which ones are needed the most)
* Other formats from other Yabber forks (Let me know which are flying around the community)

# Requirements
* WitchyBND requires [.NET Desktop Runtime 7.0](https://aka.ms/dotnet/7.0/windowsdesktop-runtime-win-x64.exe) to function.
* The game archives need to be unpacked with [UXM Selective Unpacker](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/1651) to access the files that Witchy can work with.

# Basic usage
Witchy works exactly like Yabber.

* Unpack the game files using a tool like [UXM Selective Unpacker](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/1651). (For Armored Core VI, you may currently need a work-in-progress version from [?ServerName? Discord](http://discord.gg/servername) in #tools-and-resources)
* Find the files you'd like to extract. (Information on general modding is available in the [Souls Modding Wiki](http://soulsmodding.wikidot.com/) or on [?ServerName? Discord](http://discord.gg/servername).)
* Drag the files onto the WitchyBND.exe executable in the Witchy folder.
* If Witchy supports that file format, it will now be unpacked.
* To repack, simply drag the unpacked folder or file onto WitchyBND.exe again.

If you only want to remove the DCX compression from a DCX archive, use **WitchyBND.DCX.exe** instead.

If you find it tedious to drag files onto the EXE, run **WitchyBND.Context.exe** to create Windows right-click context menu entries instead; that way, you can just right-click any file and find the "WitchyBND" option in the context menu.
