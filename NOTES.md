* Added basic initial support for ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN (thanks to Vawser and Nordgaren)
* Updated the handling of compression types to include more information. In short, this will make Witchy more robust against manipulation attempts on compression headers.
* Internally cleaned up various classes in significant ways. This may cause some regressions which will be quickly fixed once reported.
  * Several parser versions were raised due to this.
