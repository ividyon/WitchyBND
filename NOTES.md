* Added parallel processing. When enabled, Witchy operations will be multi-threaded, which should speed them up.
  * This includes parallel-processing paths entered into Witchy, as well as operations performed on file lists in binders.
  * This is disabled by default and can be enabled in the configuration (by running the EXE standalone).
  * It may not be guaranteed that the order of files in the `<files>` section of the XML manifest is strictly followed when parallelization is enabled. Do not enable if this is a concern for you (but it shouldn't be in most cases).
* Added a notice when repacking using DCX_KRAK or DCX_KRAK_MAX compression, which are extremely slow. For development purposes, a compression like DCX_DFLT_11000_44_9_15 is recommended.
  * Did you know? A FFXBND repack which normally takes ~2-10 minutes with default compression, takes less than 1 second with no compression, and only 6 seconds with the above compression type.
* Updated FXR parser version.
  * Fully cleared up how States work. "Transitions" are now "StayConditions" and their output has been cleaned up greatly.
  * Replaced all remaining "Section" names by better approximations.
  * Renamed UnkReferences and UnkExternalValues to ReferenceList and ExternalValueList.
  * Changed the XML structure of Fields to just be `<Int Value="0">` and `<Float Value="0">` instead of the verbose `<Field xsi:Type="FFXFieldFloat" Value="0">`.
* Added a stopwatch which shows how long the Witchy operation lasted.
* Made Witchy less case-sensitive about the root tags of serialized XML files.
* Fixed an issue where MTD XMLs would not de-serialize back into MTD due to a certified :forestcat: moment.
* Fixed an issue where "Operation completed" would appear when closing the configuration UI via the Exit option.
